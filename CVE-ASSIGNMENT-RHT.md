CVE Assignment HOWTO

Copyright: Red Hat 2015 Author: Kurt Seifried (kseifried@redhat.com)

This document actually described the internal procedure used at Red Hat to assign CVEs.

# Work flow

This is the work flow used to assign a CVE(s) at Red Hat. This is for both internally reported issues and issues where people have asked us to assign a CVE.

## Determine if this issue is a security vulnerability

Some security issues are not vulnerabilities. For example a buffer overflow vulnerability that requires administrative level access to exploit (e.g. argument processing in the configuration file for a daemon) does not typically result in a trust boundary being violated, ergo it is not a vulnerability (this is not to say it isn't a security issue that should be dealt with). 

### Security vulnerability

A security vulnerability is something that allows an attacker to cross a trust boundary, for example this could allow an attacker to gain privileges they do not have, to execute arbitrary code when they should not be able to, or to crash a daemon or a system that they should not be able to turn off for example. Trust boundaries can be subtle as well, for example if a program advertises a security feature like "default firewall is enabled and only allows port 22 for SSH" and then some flaw results in the firewall also allowing other protocols (even if unused) this would usually be classed as a security vulnerability.

It is important to also note that the line for what is/is not a security vulnerability is constantly moving. For example DES encryption used to be secure, but then computers got very fast and DES can now be cracked in near real time on a laptop. Other changes include default passwords, these used to be fine, but are now seen as a problem. A great example is in late 2014, downloads of software updates over HTTP were (and indeed still are) common, however unless there is some additional protections (such as RPM signing), HTTP and other clear text protocols being used to provide software updates are now seen as a vulnerability, and sites should switch to HTTPS or similar.

In summary a security vulnerability generally allows:

1. An attacker to access something
2. An attacker to execute arbitrary code/control program flow
3. Execute a denial of service easily

### Security issue

Security issues are security related problems that do not result in a trust boundary being crossed. For example a buffer overflow may exist in argument processing for a daemon, but if the only way to pass these arguments is via a configuration file owned by root:root then, generally speaking, this would be seen as a hardening issue and not an actual vulnerability. 

## CVE SPLIT/MERGE

The official CVE SPLIT/MERGE guidelines are here: https://cve.mitre.org/cve/editorial_policies/cd_abstraction.html

However I wanted to include a quick and dirty version. Basically CVE SPLIT/MERGE can be summarized as:

1. Take all your security vulnerabilities and determine the root cause
2. Split them by codebase if multiple programs are affected (this can be subtle, e.g. MySQL/MariaDB or Tomcat and JBoss)
3. Split them by vulnerability type (e.g. buffer overflow, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
4. Split them by versions affected if different (e.g. vulnerable in 1.1 through 1.5 and the other vulnerability affects 1.4 through 1.5)

There are of course many exceptions to these rules, for example if it is a common piece of code that has been recycled or embedded (e.x. expat/libxml2/gzip) then typically a single CVE would be used. 

The simplest way to cover all the exceptions is "be pragmatic", does assigning multiple CVEs help cut down on potential confusion/problems, or is it merely being pedantic? A good example of this is CVE-2009-3555 (a vulnerability in TLS), rather than assign several hundred CVE's  Mitre simple assigned a single CVE for this protocol vulnerability. 

## Take CVE's from the CVE Pool

Take CVEs from the internal Red Hat pool and make sure the changes commit correctly (e.g. that someone else hasn't used the CVE as well).

## Add CVE's to BZ as needed

If we have Bugzilla entries for the issues please add the CVEs as appropriate.

## Announce CVEs as needed

If these CVEs are for public issues (this is rare as public issues should have CVEs requested on oss-security) please post a mention of this CVE to oss-security so the community and Mitre are aware.

# Embargoed CVEs

If these CVEs are for embargoed issues please simply reply to the person requsting them, if they were requested via the distros@ list also include distros@ in the reply.
