# CVE-HOWTO
CVE assignment documentation - this document replaces http://people.redhat.com/kseifrie/CVE-OpenSource-Request-HOWTO.html

Please note that this document pertains to CVE's for issues found in Open Source programs, not closed source programs, if you need a CVE for a closed source program I suggest you go to Mitre directly.

## What is CVE?

http://cve.mitre.org/about/faqs.html

A CVE is a common name for a single security vulnerability so that we can identify and talk about issues sanely (e.g. "that OpenSSL vulnerability, from like 2009, the DoS one" vs. "CVE-2009-3555"). CVE allows multiple vendors, products, and customers to properly track security vulnerabilities and make sure they are dealt with.

The CVE database is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures that aims to provide common names for publicly known problems. The goal of CVE is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, repositories, and services) with this "common enumeration."

## Why should I get a CVE for my security issue?

Because it makes it much easier to track, discuss and otherwise handle security issues for everyone. Upstream vendors, downstream vendors, security tracking firms, customers, security products, etc. all increasingly rely upon CVE to identify issues clearly.

## Why should I get my CVE before going public?

Getting the CVE before public release makes tracking the issue much easier, if you release the issue and then get a CVE for it everyone will have to update their information (considering how many organizations consume security reports, this is a lot of effort). Also if other similar issues are released it makes tracking much easier rather than playing the "well it sounds like this one but maybe it's that other one?"

## How do I request a CVE?

There are 4 main ways to request a CVE:

1. In advance privately from secalert@redhat.com
2. In advance privately from the distros@vs.openwall.org list
3. In advance privately from Mitre cve-assign@mitre.org
4. Publicly on the oss-security@lists.openwall.com list

### secalert@redhat.com

You can request a CVE from secalert@redhat.com, this is generally the quickest way (we have a team of people that can assign CVE's). You'll need to include some basic information such as the title, type of vuln and so on so that we can make sure the assignment is done correctly. If we have any questions about the assignment we will ask, so don't worry, if something is missing or inclear we'll ask. The secalert@redhat.com GPG key is available here https://access.redhat.com/security/team/contact 

Please note that althought there is no strict limit on the time from which you request a CVE to the time you release the information we do generally ask that you take more then 30 days to release the information.

### distros@vs.openwall.org

You can request a CVE from the distros@vs.openwall.org list. This will actually be fulfuilled by Red Hat (the same people doing secalert@redhat.com basically) and has the same basic process. Please note you MUST include "[vs]" in the subject line, or else the spam filters @vs.openwall.org will eat your email. The advantage of asking for you CVE on the distros list is that it will notify a number of BSD and Linux vendors (http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros) who can then start working on their updates as well. Please note: emailing the distros@ list starts a 2 week embargo process (exceptions are made due to holidays/etc.), so if you cannot address the issue and go public in 2 weeks or less I suggest either holding off ont he CVE request, or using secalert@redhat.com directly.

### cve-assign@mitre.org

If for some reason you do not feel comfortable asking Red Hat or the distros@ list for the CVE you can request one directly from Mitre by emailing cve-assign@mitre.org. Please note that the Mitre team handles literally thousands of CVE requests a year so it may take some time for a response. 

### oss-security@lists.openwall.com

Finally if you have a public issue, or find an issue that is already public please ask for a CVE on the oss-security@lists.openwall.com mailing list, this will also notify the community of the issue. A classic example of this is the "CVE Request: Linux kernel crypto api unprivileged arbitrary module load" http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/229 which was originally found in 2013, but not made widely known as a security issue until 2015. Sooner is always better for security issues.

## How to write a CVE request:

There is not much information that is required:

1. Software name and optionally vendor name
2. Link to the software web site (so we can download to confirm it, etc.)
3. Type of vulnerability or attack outcome
4. A description of the affected code (e.g. the function name, the vulnerable web page, link to the affected code, a bug entry, etc.)
5. Ideally some information about affected versions (especially if the issue has already been corrected in a release)
6. Whether or not a CVE has previously been requested anywhere (e.g. if you emailed someone and they never got back to you), this is to prevent duplicate assignments.

## Examples of good and bad requests

### Good requests:

http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/3

http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/107

### Bad request:

http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/65 - this one is a bad request because the affected product name was mixed up (Ruby-on-rails/Ruby)
