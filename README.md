# CVE-HOWTO
CVE assignment documentation - this document replaces http://people.redhat.com/kseifrie/CVE-OpenSource-Request-HOWTO.html

Please note that this document pertains to CVE's for issues found in Open Source programs, not closed source programs, if you need a CVE for a closed source program I suggest you go to Mitre directly.

## What is CVE?

http://cve.mitre.org/about/faqs.html

A CVE is a common name for a single security vulnerability so that we can identify and talk about issues sanely (e.g. "that OpenSSL vulnerability, from like 2009, the DoS one" vs. "CVE-2009-3555"). CVE allows multiple vendors, products, and customers to properly track security vulnerabilities and make sure they are dealt with.

The CVE database is a list of information security vulnerabilities and exposures that aims to provide common names for publicly known problems. The goal of CVE is to make it easier to share data across separate vulnerability capabilities (tools, repositories, and services) with this "common enumeration."

## Why should I get a CVE for my security issue?

Because it makes it much easier to track, discuss and otherwise handle security issues for everyone. Upstream vendors, downstream vendors, security tracking firms, customers, security products, etc. all increasingly rely upon CVE to identify issues clearly.

## Why should I get my CVE before going public?

Getting the CVE before public release makes tracking the issue much easier, if you release the issue and then get a CVE for it everyone will have to update their information (considering how many organizations consume security reports, this is a lot of effort). Also if other similar issues are released it makes tracking much easier rather than playing the "well it sounds like this one but maybe it's that other one?"

## How do I request a CVE?

There are several main ways to get a CVE:

1. Check the CNA listing page and contact the correct CNA https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html
2. Request one from MITRE at https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html
3. Publicly on the oss-security@lists.openwall.com list

## How to write a CVE request:

There is not much information that is required:

1. Software name and optionally vendor name
2. Link to the software web site (so we can download to confirm it, etc.)
3. Type of vulnerability or attack outcome
4. A description of the affected code (e.g. the function name, the vulnerable web page, link to the affected code, a bug entry, etc.)
5. Ideally some information about affected versions (especially if the issue has already been corrected in a release)
6. Whether or not a CVE has previously been requested anywhere (e.g. if you emailed someone and they never got back to you), this is to prevent duplicate assignments.

## Examples of good and bad requests

### Good requests:

http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/3

http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/107

### Bad request:

http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/65 - this one is a bad request because the affected product name was mixed up (Ruby-on-rails/Ruby)

## Why doesn't my CVE show up in the database?

The two main CVE databases:

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=my+program

https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search

Rely on Mitre for entries to be created and added. Mitre does not add CVE text until they have researched the issue and written it up. This means that in a given year Mitre has approximately 8,000 to 10,000 issues in their database that need research and publishing, so there is an obvious delay, especially for issues that are not as significant/important. 

## Why was the CVE assigned days/weeks/months before going public?

Mitre has a "Date Entry Created" field in their database, this is the date the CVE was either assigned by Mitre to a specific issue, or the date that CVE was given by Mitre to another organization (such as Red Hat) for future use. For example CVE-2015-0201 through CVE-2015-0300 were assigned on November 14, 2014 to Red Hat, as of late January 2015 Red Hat has only used approximately half of these.
